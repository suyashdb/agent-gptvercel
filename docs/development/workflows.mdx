A core function of Reworkd is AI powered workflow automation. This documentation covers key concepts within our workflow platform.

## Frontend models
The workflow hierarchy follows a graph-like structure. The frontend models only prescribe the front-end view of the workflow.

- A workflow is the graph itself. It represents the workflow in its entirety
- A node is a single element within a workflow. It has a position
- An edge represents a connection between two nodes of a workflow

## Backend models
The backend models represent the mechanisms to actually perform work for a given node.
Each frontend `Node` will have an associated `Block`.
`Node` represents the frontend view / position while the `Block` represents what will actually happen when that `Node` is run.
For example, a "SlackMessageBlock" is a `Block` that, when executed, would send a user a message on "Slack".
